    <h1>A Pathetic Life</h1>
    <p>Okaka is 25 and recently became a mother. She is currently on the verge of divorce.</p>        
<p>Her husband is both verbally abusive and neglectful. After abandoning his parental responsibilities, he ceased all communication.</p>
<p>Despite everything, she struggles with the fact that she still, somehow, loves him. She is unable to take that final, necessary step toward filing for divorce.</p>
<p>The question remains: What direction will her life take next?</p>
